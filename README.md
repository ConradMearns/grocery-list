# grocery-list

An experimental grocery list, nothing to say of yet!

Some hopes...
- When an item is checked off of the grocery list, the time is recorded
  - Save a UTC datetime for future algorithms
  - Save a reference time so that we can ask questions about item order within a store.
    - Store layouts may differ, we may need to record stores (no gps, just a dropdown (initially?))
    - Reference time looks for clusters of check-times to determine an item proximity graph
- Future duplicates of items are sorted in new lists based on the referential checked time
- The application can be pinned to user devices as a PWA
  - Needs an icon
  - The app name needs to not be 'TODO'
- The application should save the users grocery list on the device it's created on
- The user can check an item off by taking a picture of the item.
  - Create a personal database of food items - track prices, nutrition information, deals, link to other databases
  - Let's the user search the personal food database by picture
  - Let's the user share grocery lists by sending reference images to friends (so they finally get the right stuff!)

# sapper-template

The default template for setting up a [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) project. Can use either Rollup or webpack as bundler.


## Getting started


### Using `degit`

To create a new Sapper project based on Rollup locally, run

```bash
npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup" my-app
```

For a webpack-based project, instead run

```bash
npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#webpack" my-app
```

[`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) is a scaffolding tool that lets you create a directory from a branch in a repository.

Replace `my-app` with the path where you wish to create the project.


### Using GitHub templates

Alternatively, you can create the new project as a GitHub reposity using GitHub's template feature.

Go to either [sapper-template-rollup](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template-rollup) or [sapper-template-webpack](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template-webpack) and click on "Use this template" to create a new project repository initialized by the template.


### Running the project

Once you have created the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.

You now have a fully functional Sapper project! To get started developing, consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev).

### Using TypeScript

By default, the template uses plain JavaScript. If you wish to use TypeScript instead, you need some changes to the project:

 * Add `typescript` as well as typings as dependences in `package.json`
 * Configure the bundler to use [`svelte-preprocess`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess) and transpile the TypeScript code.
 * Add a `tsconfig.json` file
 * Update the project code to TypeScript

The template comes with a script that will perform these changes for you by running

```bash
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

`@sapper` dependencies are resolved through `src/node_modules/@sapper`, which is created during the build. You therefore need to run or build the project once to avoid warnings about missing dependencies.

The script does not support webpack at the moment.

## Directory structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project —  `src` and `static`.


### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app — `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` — along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.


#### src/routes

This is the heart of your Sapper app. There are two kinds of routes — *pages*, and *server routes*.

**Pages** are Svelte components written in `.svelte` files. When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel. (Sapper will preload and cache the code for these subsequent pages, so that navigation is instantaneous.)

**Server routes** are modules written in `.js` files, that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods. Each function receives Express `request` and `response` objects as arguments, plus a `next` function. This is useful for creating a JSON API, for example.

There are three simple rules for naming the files that define your routes:

* A file called `src/routes/about.svelte` corresponds to the `/about` route. A file called `src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte` corresponds to the `/blog/:slug` route, in which case `params.slug` is available to the route
* The file `src/routes/index.svelte` (or `src/routes/index.js`) corresponds to the root of your app. `src/routes/about/index.svelte` is treated the same as `src/routes/about.svelte`.
* Files and directories with a leading underscore do *not* create routes. This allows you to colocate helper modules and components with the routes that depend on them — for example you could have a file called `src/routes/_helpers/datetime.js` and it would *not* create a `/_helpers/datetime` route


### static

The [static](static) directory contains any static assets that should be available. These are served using [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).

In your [service-worker.js](src/service-worker.js) file, you can import these as `files` from the generated manifest...

```js
import { files } from '@sapper/service-worker';
```

...so that you can cache them (though you can choose not to, for example if you don't want to cache very large files).


## Bundler configuration

Sapper uses Rollup or webpack to provide code-splitting and dynamic imports, as well as compiling your Svelte components. With webpack, it also provides hot module reloading. As long as you don't do anything daft, you can edit the configuration files to add whatever plugins you'd like.


## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of your app, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy your application to any environment that supports Node 10 or above. As an example, to deploy to [Vercel Now](https://vercel.com) when using `sapper export`, run these commands:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

If your app can't be exported to a static site, you can use the [now-sapper](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper) builder. You can find instructions on how to do so in its [README](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper#basic-usage).


## Using external components

When using Svelte components installed from npm, such as [@sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list), Svelte needs the original component source (rather than any precompiled JavaScript that ships with the component). This allows the component to be rendered server-side, and also keeps your client-side app smaller.

Because of that, it's essential that the bundler doesn't treat the package as an *external dependency*. You can either modify the `external` option under `server` in [rollup.config.js](rollup.config.js) or the `externals` option in [webpack.config.js](webpack.config.js), or simply install the package to `devDependencies` rather than `dependencies`, which will cause it to get bundled (and therefore compiled) with your app:

```bash
npm install -D @sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list
```


## Bugs and feedback

Sapper is in early development, and may have the odd rough edge here and there. Please be vocal over on the [Sapper issue tracker](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues).
